# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Power BI Virtual Case Experience

**Introduction:** We set out to find patterns and elements influencing customer attrition in the telecom sector. Any organisation that experiences high levels of customer turnover faces difficult challenges because it reduces client base and causes revenue to drop. Telecom firms can prevent customer churn and retain consumers by proactively addressing the elements that contribute to it.

**Data Description:** Information on 7043 distinct telecom customers, including their demographics, services used, billing information, and whether or not they churned, is contained in the data set used in this analysis. It includes elements like the customer ID, the gender, the age, the partner status, the ISP, the contract duration, the billing method, and others.

**Analysis:** We started by examining the overall turnover rate, which with 7,043 distinct customers was found to be 26.54%. After that, we conducted a data analysis to pinpoint the causes of churn. Older female clients had a high churn rate of 42.25%, which suggests that this demographic might have particular problems with the company's services or customer assistance.
Further investigation found that yearlong contract holders were less likely to churn than clients with month-to-month agreements. Additionally, fiber-optic internet users were more likely to leave the service, possibly as a result of the greater expenses involved. Customers who paid with electronic checks or postal checks had a higher chance of leaving.

**Result:** Based on analysis, we discovered that particular elements including contract length, internet service provider, form of payment, and services used are very important in determining customer churn. Company should think about providing incentives for customers to sign longer-term contracts, lowering the price of fiber-optic internet, providing more practical payment options, and highlighting the advantages of services like online backup, device protection plans, tech support plans, and online security. Enhancing the standard of technical support can also aid in lowering churn.
